# TriggerController Optimization

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Quality Improvements
- Replaced generic `Map` input/output with specific DTOs:
  - `AddTriggerRequest` - for trigger creation with validation
  - `TriggerListResponse` - for trigger list with job information
- Added comprehensive input validation using Spring Validator annotations
- Custom `TriggerValidator` to ensure either date or cron expression is provided based on trigger type
- Enhanced logging with structured English messages

### 2. Architecture Improvements
- Used `QuartzInstanceService` instead of static `Tools.getQuartzInstance()`
- Removed dependency on Struts2 components
- Followed Spring Boot best practices with dependency injection
- Added `@InitBinder` for custom validation

### 3. API Consistency
- All endpoints now return proper typed responses
- ResponseEntityAdvice automatically wraps responses in ApiResponse format
- GlobalExceptionHandler provides consistent error responses
- Added validation messages for all required fields

### 4. Functional Parity
- All features from the original TriggerAction are preserved:
  - List triggers for a specific job
  - Add new triggers (both simple and cron)
  - Delete triggers
- Fixed the missing jobId field issue by creating a proper request DTO

### 5. Error Handling
- Proper null checks and validation for all entities
- Clear error messages for missing jobs, schedulers, or triggers
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### 6. Validation Rules
- Trigger name and group are required
- Job ID must be provided and valid
- For simple triggers (dateFlag = 1): date is required
- For cron triggers (dateFlag != 1): cron expression is required

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/trigger/list?jobId={jobId}` - Get list of triggers for a job
- `POST /api/trigger/add` - Add a new trigger
- `DELETE /api/trigger/delete?uuid={uuid}` - Delete a trigger

All endpoints now follow RESTful conventions and return consistent responses.
